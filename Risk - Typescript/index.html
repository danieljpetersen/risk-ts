    <ul>
        <li>You're the color blue.</li>
        <li>At the start of every turn you get armies to assign.  Click on a territory to assign one army, right click to assign all.</li>
        <li>Once done assigning territories, click on a territory to select it.</li>
        <li>When a territory is selected, click on a neighboring territory and then right click to move or attack.</li>
        <li>Pressing enter advances the turn.</li>
        <li>Capture at least one territory per turn to earn a card</li>
        <li>There are three card types.  If you accumulate one of each card, you get an income bonus of 15 for that turn.   If you accumulate 3 of one card, you get an income bonus of 7.</li>
        <li>I didn't implement any way to view cards, but trust me when I say that they exist, and you automatically get bonuses from them.</li>
        <li>Owning all of a continent will give you also give you an income bonus.  Additionally, you get an extra 1 army per every 7 territories you own.</li>
        <li>The goal is to conquer the world.  Good luck!</li>
